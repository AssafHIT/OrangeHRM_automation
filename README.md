# 🍊 OrangeHRM Test Automation Framework

Welcome to the **Selenium Test Automation Framework** for **OrangeHRM**! This project automates functional and UI testing for the **OrangeHRM** web application, a popular Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The goal is to ensure high-quality, bug-free, and seamless user interactions in the application.

🔧 **Built With:**
- **Selenium** 🤖 - For automating browser interactions
- **Java** ☕ - For scripting and automation logic
- **JUnit 5** 🚀 - For test execution and reporting
- **Maven** 📦 - For managing project dependencies and build automation
- **Page Object Model** (POM) 📂 - For scalable, maintainable, and reusable test scripts

This framework automates testing for essential HRM workflows such as logging in, adding/removing employees, and managing employee information. The automated tests ensure the application functions as expected and is free from regressions.

The project is organized in a modular structure to enhance maintainability and scalability:

- **`src/main/java`**: Contains the page object classes representing the different pages of the OrangeHRM application.
  - **`pages`**: Includes classes such as `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`, `PIMPage`, and `BasePage`.
  
- **`src/test/java`**: Contains test classes with scenarios for login, employee management, and more.
  - **`tests`**: Includes classes like `LoginTest`, `DashboardTest`, `PIMTest`, etc.

- **`pom.xml`**: Manages project dependencies using Maven.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files should be ignored by Git (e.g., IDE configurations, build outputs).
